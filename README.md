A Python implementation of the Lox language, from the in-progress book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent)

Developed in Python 3.12+ for educational purposes, using Python as Java replacement due to familiarity. The consequential implementation in C is expected.
